<td markdown="span" style="vertical-align: top; text-align: left;">For my final year capstone project, I wanted to explore the issues of remote teaching in online courses during the pandemic. This project applied the culmination of what I learned in my three years in the Interaction Design program and is a demonstration of my UX, UI, and User Research skills. </td>

<td markdown="span" style="vertical-align: top; text-align: left;">Teaching online has its challenges and in general, has many different problems regarding the delivery of content, engaging students, and the mental health concerns of learning online. With synchronous learning being a primary mode of delivery, this puts additional stress to the professor due to the challenges mentioned above. Professors/instructors need a way to avoid pandemic fatigue because it is affecting their teaching and engagement of students.</td>
