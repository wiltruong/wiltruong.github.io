### Teaching online has its challenges
 
In mid-2020, when the pandemic started, every post-secondary school shifted to remote learning. Professors, instructors, and teachers were faced with the challenge of reconfiguring their courses to adjust for online learning. Now in the present: Zoom, Teams, and other online learning platforms are now the norm, but it isn’t just the same as it used to be.

### Understanding the current state of teaching online classes
 
I thought about last semester and realized that some of my peers didn’t turn on their cameras at all. At one point, there was a course where the professor also turned off his camera and it became audio-only as students didn’t turn on their camera either. I thought to myself, how does the professor feel when students don’t turn on their cameras? From observing a few of my professors last year, it seemed to affect them quite a bit as it would feel to them that they aren’t engaging with the students or simply talking to a screen. This in essence I saw would affect the motivation and mental state of the instructor/professor.
 
Then why? I’m curious to see what can be done because we’re all humans. We desire that human interaction but especially in an education setting – Creating that rapport with the student and helping them to the fullest is what motivates teachers the most. This research problem is purely about understanding the environment of remote learning from the perspective of the instructor/teacher/professor and looking to see if there are solutions out there, that can be used to enhance that relationship with the student-teacher when teaching online.
 
This curiosity became the motivation and the goal of the project, which is: instructors/professors need a way to avoid pandemic fatigue because it is affecting their teaching and engagement of students.
  
<br>
 
### Design principles and psychological factors
 
To guide the project, I used two design principles and two psychological as a foundation. As the project progressed, these design principles and psychological factors changed to suit the needs of the direction of the project.

### Not the be-all and end-all solution
 
As I moved forward with the project, I realized that there are many other strategies and solutions out there that solve the challenges associated with teaching remotely (i.e. work-life balance separation, strategies, and such). One important thing was that I recognized that my end solution isn’t a be-all and end-all solution, but rather I want to contribute to solving this issue and creating awareness using the research that I gained.
 
I developed four assumptions that I went into the project – Before doing the research:

    <td></td>
    <td align="center" style="vertical-align: top;">Teaching online is not as engaging as teaching in-class</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>   

### The plan
 
To be organized with the project, I used the tried and true “Double Diamond” design process which provided a framework and structure to my exploration and research. I used this design process because it is focused on the user (i.e. instructors, professors, and teachers) and research. In addition to this, the process also factors in continuous feedback and iteration, which will help narrow down the potential solution to the problem.

### Research, research, and more research
 
To fully understand what professors or teachers go through when teaching online, both primary and secondary research needed to be done. I started with secondary research, to get a general feel of the landscape and found:

    <td align="center" style="vertical-align: top;">Everything points to Pandemic Fatigue: In this case, remote teaching, zoom fatigue, and other factors. Most of these contribute things like burnout, lack of motivation, which affect the teaching environment.</td>
    <td></td>

  </tr>
</table>

<br>   

I performed observational research and interviews to further understand what professors go through in my classes and program. For my observational research, I used the AEIOU framework (Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, and Users) to observe my 4th-year classes to see how professors engage with students. My findings from my observational research were:
 
-	A sense of fatigue from the professor, although other factors like personal life can attribute to this. 
-	Maintaining the relationship of a student by addressing them, casually talking, using the chat, polling, and such - This creates a positive environment for both the professor and student
-	Group activities in breakout rooms tend to have more activity like students turning on their cameras, engagement, etc.
-	When there is no engagement from students, professors use different strategies to engage them through discussion and asking them questions. Although, professors are more accepting because it’s in an online environment.
 
For my interviews, they were unstructured and I interviewed two professors and two teacher assistants. The goal was to find out:
 
-	The interviewee’s perspective on online teaching during the pandemic
-	Their emotions when teaching online classes
-	Engaging students and strategies
-	Expectations and opinions regarding the current landscape of remote learning
 
My findings were:
 
-	Student engagement is still low in an online setting, which is frustrating and can invoke emotions to the professor like isolation.
-	Visual feedback is very important to understand if the student is getting that content or not, but in an online setting, tools are used like polls, the chat, and other things to get that feedback.
-	The amount of effort in preparing classes is very much high and contributes to that fatigue but this effort needs to be done on the student side.
-	Both sides need to make effort to engage each other to create a positive learning environment, where the professor can provide that support closely with the student.
-	Technology plays a huge role in that fatigue and can affect someone who is just starting to teach or even learning telecommunication conference software like Zoom or other online tools for teaching online.
-	Professors understand the problems of students regarding turning on their cameras but it should be expected by now that they should maximize that engagement in the classroom and create a positive environment.
-	To reduce pandemic fatigue, some strategies are used to separate work and life - Things like having only a certain amount of hours for student questions or meetings, or allowing meetings when the student contacts the professor, instead of putting office hours
-	Teaching assistants (i.e. PAL Leaders) feel the same way, despite them being students as well - They find other strategies to engage with the student like common interests, current relatable themes (i.e. memes), and even talking about future years in the program, can invoke that engagement.

<br>   

### A new direction
 
With my insights, I decided to move in a different direction:
 
> How might we improve student engagement in an online class to create a positive and collaborative learning environment?
 
This is because the new direction provides a focus as the problem lies with students engaging in class rather than on the Professor/Instructor side. From the interviews and insights, it was clear that Professors use strategies to engage students but ultimately it is up to the student to put in that effort. This creates a question of if a student doesn’t engage and becomes “invisible.” How would the professor identify these “invisible” students who don’t engage? How can they identify these students to ensure that they are doing well? This created a lot of questions, which resulted in going back to the Define stage to further understand the problem space and identify a potential solution.
 
With a new direction, I decided to do more design research like affinity mapping, more observational research, as is/to be scenarios, and needs statements, which led me to:
 
> Professors/Instructors need a way to improve student engagement in an online class because it provides a meaningful connection between the course content and processor/instructor.
 
<br>

### Prototyping and testing
 
Mock-ups were created to show the functionality of a Zoom app, which is called “Seek.” I decided to use Zoom as a platform because Zoom is frequently used for online synchronous learning. It integrates into Zoom and has dashboard functionality outside of the app.
 
![image]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tr-ft-3.png)
 
Since it is a Zoom app, it appears on the left-hand side (just like any Zoom app), the Professor can view quickly through a simple data visualization of the student engagement via microphone or video. The app also highlights different students who didn’t participate, allowing the Professor to call out or work closely with that student to ensure they are understanding the content.
 
![image]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tr-ft-3.png)
 
The dashboard component of the app shows more detailed information and uses data visualization to display that data simplistically. There is also functionality to identify which student didn’t participate in the lecture.

<br>

### Final prototype
 
User testing was done with the app in the form of showing mock-ups and asking for feedback. Since this project didn’t require a fully functional app, I took advantage of showing the prototype through XD to as many people as possible (i.e. professors and teacher assistants).
 
The feedback gained was:
 
-	Thinking about how this data is used in the context of student engagement.
-	At the end of the day, this data isn’t a representation of the student’s learning.
-	How it would be applied to a larger student class size.
-	How different types of teachers would be comfortable looking at this data.
-	Providing “summary” e-mails to the Professor as a form of communication
 
Using the feedback from user testing, several changes were made for the final prototype:
 
-	Addition of customization buttons, so the Professor or teacher can turn on and off different parts of the app. Being able to turn certain aspects on and off can decrease anxiety when teaching, especially if the Professor is new to teaching.

-	There wasn’t much iteration for this part of the app as the feedback was generally good and didn’t require too much change to the overall UI.
 
![image]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tr-ft-3.png)
 
For the dashboard, several changes were made:
 
-	Making the overall graph customizable with colour, type, and also what data it is showing.
-	Moving some aspects of the dashboard so it reads from high-level information to more granular (detailed) data.
-	Improving the overall dashboard by “humanizing” the dashboard and addition of graphics so it is friendly to the user.
-	Adjusting colours and various text.
 
![image]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tr-ft-3.png)
 
Several goals would benefit a Professor (or teacher) using this app:
 
-	Professors can easily gauge how their classes are doing at a glance. Chunking the data into different sections allows the Professor to easily understand that data and make a quick decision on whether if their strategy is working or not.

-	The app identifies who isn’t participating in the class, which would provide an opportunity to the Professor to follow up with the student or use other strategies for engagement in class (i.e. breakout rooms, group work).

-	Providing a level of customizability for the Professor so they can compare other classes that they teach and see what strategies are working and what isn’t working.

-	Ultimately, all of this boils down to encouraging that interaction just like an in-class lecture would be. The psychological factor is that how we, as humans, expect the same social interactions as online interactions.

### The takeaways
 
> Applying what I learned in my courses
 
Through the three years in the Interaction Design programs, I learned the fundamentals of design to user-centered design to understanding how to design for people. I realized the skills that I gained through my courses, this project was a test of those skills and also challenging them. I found that I have still much to learn like my user research skills and applying design principles and psychological factors into my designs. Not only this but I continue to learn a lot about myself as a designer and what I can improve on next time around.
 
> Pushing myself as a designer
 
Sometimes I question myself as a designer if my process is correct or even if my solution makes sense or not. What made me move forward for this project was pushing myself to create something – Even if it was terrible. The realization that at times our ideas can be bad, didn’t come into my head until that point in time. By pushing forward and laying out what I had, in terms of my research and ideas, I saw a path that I was able to go towards. I think that not thinking about failure, not worrying about the overall design, and simply just “doing it” helped me focus on the prototype and eventually got me moving to finish the project overall.
 
> Designing for others
 
This project challenged me, not only as a designer but as an individual as well. It taught me how I can design for others, but the most important thing is using empathy to understand the other side. Throughout the project, I kept the user in focus, and understanding what they felt when they are teaching online was very important to me. I felt what they felt when I was asking my professors questions and started realizing as a student, that engagement during class was critical. I could never forget this feeling and it’s something that I look to bring forward to my design career.
